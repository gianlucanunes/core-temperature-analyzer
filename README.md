### Overview
***
Hello! I created this project when I was struggling to analyze my CPU temperature. I was using Core Temp to measure it, but I did not know about its logging feature. Once I
discovered it, I thought "maybe I can create a Python program which analyzes the log files created by Core Temp and returns the average temperature from the last 5 days!" and I did it! It is a very simple solution yet, but I am planning to add more features and make it totally automated. Below, we have the features and, after that, a detailed tutorial
of how to set up the program and start using it.

### Features
***
- Organizes the measured temperatures in a intuitive spreadsheet (date + temperatures)
- Gives you the average temperature from the last 5 days
- Gives you the average temperature in each of the 5 days
- You can work with Celsius or Fahrenheit
